# Building
Pentane uses Visual Studio 2022 (MSBuild) as its build system, as it plays nicely with vcpkg; which is what it uses for pulling dependencies.
Pentane uses [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) in manifest mode, and depends on the following libraries:
- tomlplusplus (Used for `toml` parsing)
- detours (Required by sunset)
- zydis (Required by sunset)

Additionally, Pentane depends on [sunset](https://github.com/itsmeft24/sunset), an inline/replacement hooking library. As of writing, sunset is directly included in the repository, but will likely be *converted into a git submodule* in the future.
